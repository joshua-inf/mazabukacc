        news: `ZAMBIA Union for Persons with Disabilities President has charged that the current set up of Constituency Development Fund - CDF management is unfair to people with disabilities Speaking in an interview with Byta FM News in Livingstone, Tuesday, Pascal Mulenga, has noted the need for Parliament to design a specific CDF Policy to carter to the needs of persons with disabilities. Mulenga explains that currently, persons with disabilities are finding it very difficult to access CDF due to reasons ranging from lack of enough sensitization to non-friendly guidelines. He fears that persons with disabilities are likely not to benefit anything from CDF if they are not provided with a package specifically designed for them. And Livingstone’s Sekute Ward Councilor, John Simulinda, says the vastness of Katombola Ward is posing a challenge to persons with disabilities to access CDF due to mobility issues. He explained that it is difficult for the disabled to move to the Civic Centre on the wheelchair to access CDF.`,
